# Handwritten-Digits-ML-Model
This project predicts handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It explores Random Forest Classifier, SVM, and CNN models, comparing their complexity, performance, and efficiency. Results show CNN as the most accurate. The repository provides a detailed analysis of each model's capabilities and performance on the MNIST dataset.
